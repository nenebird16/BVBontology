# BeachBook Ontology Use Cases

This document illustrates practical applications of the BeachBook ontology through example use cases.

## Use Case 1: Personalized Practice Planning

### Scenario
Coach Sarah needs to create practice plans for Alex, an advanced player who has been struggling with serve reception in recent competitions.

### Knowledge Graph Solution
1. **Assessment Gap Analysis**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (a:Athlete {name: 'Alex Johnson'})-[self:SELF_ASSESSED]->(s:Skill {name: 'Passing'}),
         (c:Coach)-[coach:COACH_ASSESSED]->(s)
   RETURN s.name, self.rating, coach.rating, 
          abs(self.rating - coach.rating) AS gap,
          CASE WHEN self.rating > coach.rating THEN 'overestimation'
               ELSE 'underestimation' END AS gap_type
   ```

2. **Targeted Drill Recommendation**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (s:Skill {name: 'Passing'})
   MATCH (d:Drill)-[:DEVELOPS]->(s)
   WHERE d.visual_elements IS NOT NULL
   RETURN d.name, d.description, d.intensity, d.visual_elements
   ORDER BY d.intensity
   ```

3. **Visual Skill Integration**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (f:Framework {name: 'Visual-Motor Integration'})
   MATCH (d:Drill)-[:ALIGNS_WITH]->(f)
   MATCH (d)-[:DEVELOPS]->(s:Skill {name: 'Passing'})
   RETURN d.name, d.description, d.visual_elements
   ```

### Implementation
Sarah uses the BeachBook app to:
1. View Alex's self-assessment vs. her coach assessment for passing
2. Generate a practice plan focused on passing with visual skill integration
3. Sequence drills with progressive difficulty
4. Assign specific visual focus elements for each drill

### Outcome
- Alex works through a customized practice plan addressing both technical passing skills and the underlying visual elements
- Progress tracking shows improvement in pass accuracy after three weeks
- Visual skill assessment shows improved ball trajectory prediction

## Use Case 2: Team Development Planning

### Scenario
Coach Mark needs to prepare his youth development team for an upcoming tournament but has limited practice time.

### Knowledge Graph Solution
1. **Team Skill Gap Analysis**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (tg:TrainingGroup {name: 'Youth Development Program'})
   MATCH (a:Athlete)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(tg)
   MATCH (a)-[assessed:SELF_ASSESSED]->(s:Skill)
   WITH s, avg(assessed.rating) AS avg_rating, count(a) AS athlete_count
   WHERE athlete_count > 3
   RETURN s.name, avg_rating, athlete_count
   ORDER BY avg_rating
   ```

2. **Practice Plan Generation**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (tg:TrainingGroup {name: 'Youth Development Program'})
   MATCH (a:Athlete)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(tg)
   MATCH (a)-[assessed:SELF_ASSESSED]->(s:Skill)
   WITH s, avg(assessed.rating) AS avg_rating
   WHERE avg_rating < 7
   WITH s ORDER BY avg_rating LIMIT 3
   MATCH (d:Drill)-[:DEVELOPS]->(s)
   RETURN s.name, collect(d.name) AS recommended_drills
   ```

3. **Equipment Optimization**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (e:Equipment)
   WHERE e.name IN ['Volleyballs', 'Cones', 'Targets']
   MATCH (d:Drill)-[:REQUIRES]->(e)
   WITH d, collect(e.name) AS equipment
   MATCH (d)-[:DEVELOPS]->(s:Skill)
   RETURN d.name, d.duration, collect(s.name) AS skills_developed
   ```

### Implementation
Mark uses the BeachBook app to:
1. Identify the three skills with lowest average ratings across the team
2. Generate a practice plan addressing these skills
3. Optimize for limited equipment availability
4. Schedule focused 90-minute sessions

### Outcome
- Team practices target the specific skill gaps most impacting performance
- Limited equipment is used efficiently across different stations
- Players rotate through stations working on complementary skills
- Tournament results show improvement in previously weak areas

## Use Case 3: Player Development Tracking

### Scenario
Alex wants to track his progress in serving skills and understand how his visual abilities impact his performance.

### Knowledge Graph Solution
1. **Skill Progress Monitoring**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (a:Athlete {name: 'Alex Johnson'})-[practiced:PRACTICED]->(s:Skill {name: 'Jump Serve'})
   WITH a, s, practiced
   ORDER BY practiced.timestamp
   WITH collect({date: practiced.timestamp, rating: practiced.quality_rating}) AS practice_history
   RETURN practice_history
   ```

2. **Visual Skill Correlation**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (a:Athlete {name: 'Alex Johnson'})-[practiced:PRACTICED]->(s:Skill)
   WHERE s.visualRequirements IS NOT NULL
   WITH s, avg(practiced.quality_rating) AS avg_quality,
        s.visualRequirements AS visual_elements
   RETURN s.name, avg_quality, visual_elements
   ORDER BY avg_quality DESC
   ```

3. **Recommended Next Steps**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (a:Athlete {name: 'Alex Johnson'})-[self:SELF_ASSESSED]->(s:Skill {name: 'Jump Serve'})
   MATCH (d:Drill)-[:DEVELOPS]->(s)
   WHERE NOT (a)-[:EXECUTED]->(d)
   RETURN d.name, d.description, d.intensity, d.visual_elements
   ORDER BY d.intensity
   ```

### Implementation
Alex uses the BeachBook app to:
1. View historical skill progress charts
2. Identify connections between visual skills and performance
3. Find new drills to try for continued improvement
4. Schedule personal training sessions focused on visual elements

### Outcome
- Alex gains insights into the visual components affecting his serving
- Self-directed practice becomes more targeted and effective
- Performance analytics show correlation between visual training and skill improvement
- Tournament results validate the personalized development approach

## Use Case 4: Visual-Motor Integration Framework Implementation

### Scenario
The coaching staff wants to implement a systematic approach to visual-motor integration training across all skill levels.

### Knowledge Graph Solution
1. **Framework Structure Analysis**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (f:Framework {name: 'Visual-Motor Integration'})
   MATCH (f)-[:INTEGRATES]->(sc:StrategicConcept)
   RETURN f.description, collect(sc.name) AS related_concepts
   ```

2. **Drill Categorization by Visual Element**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (d:Drill)
   WHERE d.visual_elements IS NOT NULL
   WITH DISTINCT d.visual_elements AS visual_element, collect(d.name) AS drills
   RETURN visual_element, drills, size(drills) AS drill_count
   ORDER BY drill_count DESC
   ```

3. **Progressive Skill Development Path**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH path = (s1:Skill)-[:REQUIRES*]->(s2:Skill)
   WHERE s1.visualRequirements IS NOT NULL AND s2.visualRequirements IS NOT NULL
   WITH s1, s2, length(path) AS dependency_depth
   RETURN s1.name AS advanced_skill, 
          s2.name AS foundation_skill,
          s1.visualRequirements,
          s2.visualRequirements,
          dependency_depth
   ORDER BY dependency_depth
   ```

### Implementation
The coaching staff uses the BeachBook app to:
1. Map visual elements across all skills and drills
2. Create a progression framework from fundamental to advanced visual skills
3. Develop level-appropriate practice plans emphasizing visual training
4. Implement consistent visual skill assessment protocols

### Outcome
- Comprehensive visual-motor training program implemented across all levels

## Use Case 5: Knowledge-Driven App Development

### Scenario
The development team needs to prioritize new BeachBook app features that will best support coaches and athletes.

### Knowledge Graph Solution
1. **Framework-Feature Alignment**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (feat:Feature)
   MATCH (feat)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(f:Framework)
   RETURN feat.name, feat.description, collect(f.name) AS supporting_frameworks
   ```

2. **Feature Dependency Analysis**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH path = (feat1:Feature)-[:DEPENDS_ON*]->(feat2:Feature)
   RETURN feat1.name AS dependent_feature,
          [node IN nodes(path) | node.name][1..-1] AS intermediate_dependencies,
          feat2.name AS base_feature,
          length(path) AS dependency_depth
   ORDER BY dependency_depth DESC
   ```

3. **User Role Targeting**:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (feat:Feature)
   WITH feat, split(feat.user_roles, ', ') AS roles
   UNWIND roles AS role
   WITH role, collect(feat.name) AS features
   RETURN role, features, size(features) AS feature_count
   ORDER BY feature_count DESC
   ```

### Implementation
The development team uses the knowledge graph to:
1. Identify core features that implement key frameworks
2. Map feature dependencies to create logical development roadmap
