Knowledge graph schema and ontology for beach volleyball coaching and player development.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the ontology and knowledge graph implementation for beach volleyball coaching and player development. It serves as the data foundation for the BeachBook application, integrating:

1. **Core Beach Volleyball Domain**
   - Skills (passing, setting, attacking, etc.)
   - Drills with detailed metadata
   - Training frameworks like Visual-Motor Integration
   - Practice plans with sequences and progressions

2. **Specialized Training Elements**
   - Visual focus elements (ball tracking, peripheral awareness) 
   - Drill initiation types (partner toss, coach on box)
   - Feedback mechanisms
   - Drill categorization and sequencing logic

3. **BeachBook App Integration**
   - Feature nodes connected to volleyball frameworks
   - Feature dependencies and relationships
   - Practice plan generation connections

## Current Implementation

The knowledge graph emphasizes the visual-motor integration aspects of beach volleyball training while providing a structure that can support AI-assisted practice planning through the BeachBook application.

### Approach Used

1. **Schema Design**: Created a comprehensive ontology based on Notion databases
2. **Data Import**: Built nodes and relationships from Drills & Games, Frameworks, and Practice Plans
3. **Enhanced Modeling**: Added specialized nodes for deeper training context
4. **Relationship Building**: Established meaningful connections between all elements
5. **Verification**: Tested with queries to ensure practical applications work

## Repository Structure

- `/docs`: Conceptual documentation of the ontology
  - `/schema`: Entity and relationship definitions
  - `/examples`: Sample use cases and data models
- `/implementation`: Technical implementation details
  - `/neo4j`: Neo4j-specific schema and queries
  - `/cypher`: Common query patterns
- `/integration`: Application integration points
  - `/api`: API endpoints for BeachBook application
  - `/procedures`: Custom procedures for AI-assisted planning

## Next Steps

To continue developing this knowledge graph:

1. **Data Enrichment**:
   - Import more drills with their complete metadata
   - Add athlete nodes with skill proficiencies
   - Expand training groups with complete team rosters
   - Add weather conditions and court-specific adaptations

2. **Query Development**:
   - Create parameterized queries for practice plan generation
   - Build recommendation queries based on skill gaps
   - Develop drill progression paths based on player skill levels
   - Add temporal analysis of skill development

3. **Knowledge Graph Integration**:
   - Connect to BeachBook backend via API endpoints
   - Create procedures for AI agent utilization
   - Add visualization components for coaching dashboards
   - Implement automated data import from Notion

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Add weighted relationships for more nuanced recommendations
   - Implement temporal awareness for tracking improvement
   - Develop drill recommendation algorithms based on previous practice success
   - Create player-specific adaptation models

5. **Maintenance Plan**:
   - Schedule regular updates from Notion databases
   - Create version tracking for ontology changes
   - Implement validation checks for data consistency
   - Develop monitoring for relationship health
